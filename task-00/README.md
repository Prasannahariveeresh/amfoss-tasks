# Setting Up Linux for Development

## Introduction
Linux is widely recognized among developers for its robust security measures, stable performance, and flexibility. Its open-source nature allows for extensive customization and adaptation to various development needs.

## My Setup
I have been using Ubuntu as my primary operating system since version 20. I do not use Windows, so there's no need for dual booting or installing it again. Now, I am fully equipped to perform all the tasks in a Linux environment.
