## Overall Learning Progress
Throughout the tasks, I learned how to effectively program, develop applications. I also improved my way of approaching a problem while tackling various challenges and learning new frameworks in a short span of time. Tasks 7 and 9 were particularly interesting, allowing me to experiment with Flutter for developing an eye-catching mobile app and scraping data from a website. Overall, these tasks have matched my skills and experience, preparing me well for AmFOSS's recruitment. I'm excited to work with the club on research and open-source projects. Thank you!
