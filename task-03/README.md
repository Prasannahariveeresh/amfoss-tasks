# Task-03: Exploring Multiple Programming Languages

In this task, I explored various programming languages by solving four sub-tasks in Python, Ruby, Elixir, Javascript, Java, Go, C, C++, Rust, and Haskell.

## Sub-Tasks

### Sub-Task 1: "Hello, World!"
This sub-task involved writing a simple program to print "Hello, World!" to the console.

### Sub-Task 2: File Read and Write
The goal was to read a string from a file named `input.txt` and write the same string to another file named `output.txt`.

### Sub-Task 3: Diamond Pattern Generator
This sub-task required writing a program that takes a number `n` from the user and generates a diamond pattern of asterisks (`*`) which is printed to the console.

### Sub-Task 4: Diamond Pattern from File
In this sub-task, the number `n` was read from a file named `input.txt`, and the diamond pattern was written to a file named `output.txt`.

## Organization of Solutions

Each sub-task was implemented in the following programming languages:
- **Python**
- **Ruby**
- **Elixir**
- **JavaScript**
- **Java**
- **Go**
- **C**
- **C++**
- **Rust**
- **Haskell**

All solutions are organized in folders for each programming language inside the `task-03` directory of my repository. Each language folder contains separate files for each of the sub-tasks as follows:
- `subtask1` - Solution for Sub-Task 1
- `subtask2` - Solution for Sub-Task 2
- `subtask3` - Solution for Sub-Task 3
- `subtask4` - Solution for Sub-Task 4

## Completion
All sub-tasks have been successfully implemented in each programming language. This task helped me deepen my understanding of various programming paradigms and strengthened my ability to solve problems across different languages.
